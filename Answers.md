1. What are the order of insertions/removals for the following data structures?  
* **Stack**  
Stacks are LIFO (Last In First Out) so when you add something to the top of the stack, you need to remove that one first.
* **Queue**  
Queues are FIFO, so the first element to be added to the queue will be the first one to be removed.


2. What is the retrieval time complexity for the following data structures?  
* **Linked List**  
O(n)
* **Hash Table**  
Best: O(1) Worst: O(n)
* **Binary Search Trees**  
O(log(n))


3. What are some advantages to using a Hash Table over an array in JavaScript?  
* Each value is associated with a key, so you can label information as well as quickly retrieve it.
* You don't have to iterate through an entire array to search for a value.
